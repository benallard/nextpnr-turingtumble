An Architecture definition to generate instruction for a TuringTumble board.

I already tried, back in June 2019 to do that, unfortunately, I have no idea anymore what I tried.

So this time I'll start with some documentation.

There is this video from Claire @oe1cxw on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbwrOff59ck about defining custom archs for nextpnr.

And there is this 'simple' example architecture: https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr/tree/master/generic/examples.

This directory did not changed much for the last three years.

It seems, however, that yosys must be tackled first.
Indeed, at first, we will need to synthetise Verilog code into TuringTumble cells.

So better start looking into the https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/examples/cmos example directory, and see if we can define our cells there.

See TuringTumble.txt for a description of the board as an 'architecture'.

What you'll need:

* nextpnr-generic
* yosys

I need to get a grip on the problem first.
How about formally veifying some board solutions.
