An Architecture definition for nextpnr to generate instruction for a TuringTumble board.

I already tried, back in June 2019 to do that, unfortunately, I have no idea anymore what I tried.

So this time I'll start with some documentation.

There is this video from Claire @oe1cxw on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbwrOff59ck

And there is this 'simple' example architecture: https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr/tree/master/generic/examples. This directory did not changed much for the last three years.

See TuringTumble.txt for a description of the board as an 'architecture'.
